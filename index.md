### Summary
I drive data-driven innovation in business operations by building analytical systems that turn raw data into actionable insights â€“ reducing costs, accelerating timelines, and solving previously intractable problems. My expertise spans predictive modeling, generative AI, ML Ops and large-scale distributed systems. I specialize in quickly learning and adopting new technologies, turning them into business outcomes.

### AI/ML for Operations
* ML-Guided Network Restoration: Using historical data about patterns of mobile user activity on cell towers to understand the impact of tower outages and prioritize restoration efforts.
* AI & Automation for Operations: Used LLMs to interpret natural-language notes on cell-site trouble tickets, providing technicians with summaries of recent repairs and eliminating redundant field diagnostics.
* Process Compliance: Developed LLM classifiers to flag erroneous jeopardy statuses in fiber installation orders. This has a direct impact on customer satisfaction by detecting orders erroneously cancelled by the provider.
  
### AI/ML improving Business Efficiency
* Permit Timelines: Using supervised ML models to forecast the time needed for processing of construction permits in wide-area fiber-to-premises projects. Optimizing $2M+ project budgets and allowing earlier revenue recognition.
* Project Health Monitoring: Used generative AI to summarize project notes and milestone dates on wide-area fiber-to-premises projects, to auto-summarize fiber deployment milestones and diagnose deadline misses.

  
### Experience
`October 2010 - Present `
__AT&T Labs, Inc. PMTS__

I have been fortunate to work with a variety of enterprise-scale systems for data analytics, and looked to as an innovator who can propose and implement applications using these systems that deliver business value. My projects include enterprise-scale systems to:
* Assess network performance in real-time using "big data" distributed processing techniques (Spark)
* Localize network faults and aid restoration efforts via automated data collection and analytics
* Unlock previously-ignored unstructured data sources (call transcripts, human-written notes) to increase business efficiency using NLP and LLM approaches.
* Train ML models to forecast import events in business processes and to detect deviations from historical behavior

My strengths are in applied research, but I have also excelled in roles requiring production IT skills and am familiar with the software development life cycle: coding standards, code reviews, agile development, testing and operational support.

`2007 - 2010 `
__Telcordia Technologies Senior Research Scientist__
* Business Development: Focused on the application of mobile communications technology to health care, and building multidisciplinary teams to execute projects in this area. Identified, met and communicated with external medical experts and grant officers to define multi-organizational research projects.
* Innovation: Developed innovative concepts for clinical and wellness monitoring that combine medical device and mobile networking technology. These have been the basis of multiple grant applications and IP filings.
* Relationships: Represented the organization in external professional societies and standards organizations in telemedicine and mobile network technology for health informatics. Invited to speak on panel discussions at national meetings.
* Proposed a strategy for collecting public data on the geospatial location of broadband availability that was a key component of a $3.5M contract win from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.

`2005 - 2007 `
__Sarnoff Corporation Program Manager/Member of Technical Staff__
* Project Management: Program manager for new real-time vision processing systems, managing technical experts, external engineering resources, schedules, and product delivery in a $2M investment program.
* Innovation, Business Development, Proposal Wins:
    * Conceived a patent-pending idea for monitoring cognitive performance of warfighters using physiologic sensors (Mobile Evaluation Tool for Operational Readiness and Remediation - MENTOR), leading to a $1.8M contract award.
    * Conceived a system to estimate caloric content of meals via a mobile phone's camera, the basis of a $3.6 million U01 research grant from NIH-NHLBI.

`1996 - 2005 `
__Telcordia Technologies Senior Scientist__
* Technical leader of a $25M Telcordia program to develop software tools for the simulation of optical data networks.
* Development of a Java-based application for analysis of telecom network traffic (SONET/SDH frames) for a government client.
* Software developer in Telcordia's Service and Business Management Systems group, building web-based applications for telephony service creation and management.

`1989 - 1996 `
__Ohmeda/The BOC Group Staff Scientist__
* Responsible for applied research and electronic, pneumatic, mechanical, and optical medical instrumentation.
* R&D leading to the first ICU ventilator able to maintain closed-loop control over airway pressure.
* Developed advanced analytical algorithms for an infrared respiratory gas analyzer (U.S. patent granted).
* Developed an anesthetic agent sensor and improved its manufacturing process.
* Participated in the development of a diagnostic instrument for in vivo blood gas measurement.
* Produced four U.S patents in four years in medical instrumentation technologies.
